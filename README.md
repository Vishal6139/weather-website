This Weather App is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. It fetches data from a public weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) and displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain, etc.).
